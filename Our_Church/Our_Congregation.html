    <p>The Church of Jesus Christ is a people whom the Triune God has set apart in His eternal love to save for His own glory and praise. The Church is called through the Gospel, “out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation” (Revelation 5:9) as sinners repent from their sins and trust in Christ as Lord and Savior. All who trust in Christ receive the forgiveness of their sins, eternal life, and every spiritual blessing in heaven (Ephesians 1:3). This people are new creations in Christ who grow in holiness, serve God, seek the salvation of souls, and assemble to worship the Triune God in Christ.</p>

<p>First Reformed Presbyterian Church is one congregation of this Church of Christ. We are sinners saved by grace who seek to glorify God in all of life. We are a diverse people made up of young and old, rich and poor, parents and students, and multi-ethnic, but united in Jesus Christ. Out of love to God we desire to honor Him by worshipping Him as He commands, studying and obeying His Word, actively kill sin and grow in holiness, proclaim the good news of salvation to lost sinners, and serve in the Church with the gifts He has given us.</p>

<p>Our Church is a member of the <a href="https://rpcna.org/">Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America</a>. This is a denomination that has existed in the USA &amp; Canada since (date). The RPCNA currently has ??? congregations, missions, and church plants active in the USA, Canada, Japan, South Sudan, Pakistan, India, &amp; Chile. As a denomination we confess the Westminster Standards and the <a href="https://rpcna.org/history/constitution.pdf">RP Testimony</a> as a summary of the Bible’s teaching concerning doctrine, worship, and church government. For further information on our denomination and what we believe please see the RPCNA website (linked above).</p>
